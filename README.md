# Data Structures & Algorithms

This is the base folder for Data Structures and Algorithm Experiments.

Navigate to lab3/python to find my experiments of Binary Search Trees, and the effects of changing different Hashing Parameters and Methods, or lab5/python to find my experiments with BnB and DP algorithms.

Each of these destinations contains a report.txt file, where I document my findings and analysis on the various trade-offs of data structures & algorithms.
